\begin{abstract}
In this study, It checks how can basic rule-based ai can predict the Seattle Weather, finding out if it has either rainy days or dry days, and also another ai if it can check if it has warm or chilly. This shows straight forward basic ai, with no need of complex training alike with machine learning, but this ai still can give useful results most of the time. With the data values pulled from the CSV, the research built 2 different rule-based ai models to test and compare them. One model assumes the day is wet if the drops hits more than 0.1 mm, and the other model says it's warm if its temperature hits more that 10 Celsius.

Models were run on Python using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and ScikitLearn. The performance gets checked through the measure metrics via accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. The first model finding says that it hit 96.4\% accuracy and 100\% at precision but the recall at 92.6\%. With the second model it received all perfect scores on every metric score, perfectly sorting all the warm from cold days with no errors

This shows the rule-based is not very flexible but can work well when you need clear fast results. Still even though these model don't learn over time. They're very dependable when the data is steady. So when the weather suddenly shifts or any info and data is missing, the performance of the model will drop quickly. So with that, their open structures makes the decision easier to understand, which can help in important situations. Adding them on with learning algorithms can boost how they can quickly react to real-time world conditions. In essence, this rule-based model can give solid useful weather prediction.

\section{Introduction}


Weather predictions plays a key role in today’s world. From how we travel around, cultivating plants, gatherings, staying safe and how we simply go normal in our daily lives. Good predictions empower people and groups to decide wisely, lessen dangers, and gear up for whatever comes. Though today’s methods frequently utilize sophisticated computer programs, space-based observations, alongside detailed simulations of the atmosphere, even basic techniques can reveal useful information. Essentially, some AI works by following a set of clear instructions; if this happens, then do that. Because they are so straightforward to understand and also easy to build, these systems come in handy where processing power isn’t abundant, or knowing how a decision was reached matters.

We made two rule-based artificial intelligence models that predict Seattle weather, if a day is rainy or not. These systems rely on established rules. One looks at how much it rains or snows, or drizzles and to decide if a day qualifies as "wet." Testing both with past weather records. Then figures out if the day was warm or cold by looking at the highest temperature, then finally, we check it by how the prediction matched up with the real weather data from the dataset.

Both of the models are scored using key measurements such as accuracy, precision. Recall and finally the F1 score. Instead of merely just noting the correct responses, these numbers demonstrate the actual effectiveness each one are. Accuracy gives a general sense of how correct it is, precision shows how trustworthy the positive results are, recall shows the success at the findings it matters, and finally the F1 score is the middle ground between both precision and recall.

This finds at what will work and what does not work. With AI that follows fixed-based rules. Even though the system is not always accurate at predicting the outcome as more the recent models, the simplicity, usability and how can easily people can understand them, which make them useful where speed is important and needed in crucial events.





% ---------- LITERATURE REVIEW ----------
\section{Literature Review}


\subsection{What is Rule-based?}

According to GeeksforGeeks (2024), These systems make decisions, carry out tasks, or draw conclusions using a set of predetermined rules and logic.Essentially, these systems operate methodically. First, they hold a collection of "when this happens, do that" of rules. Next, where the component examines the new information, comparing it to those rules. In the end, when a match is found, the model will then perform the chosen action orwill reach a decision.  Since every choice directly link to a clear rule, and this system gives out trustworthy transparent results, making it easier to understand the logic behind it and to confirm how it operates. Therefore, they excel when dealing within situations where it is stable, like doing regular inspections, meeting regulation and rules, or handling customer service concerns. While these systems are consistent, however they can not be improved with time because as they have trouble dealing with unanticipated events. In result, if in a scenario where it deviates away from their predetermined instruction, system errors or someone needs to manually fix it. Rule-Based systems has been the starting point for artificial intelligence as because they are always reliable and straightforward. But since they dont learn anything or can't adjust to some approaches, they very lack flexibility. 
\subsection{Relative Review in Rule-Based AI in Weather Prediction}
Smart tool like analyzing the weather data are becoming more traction since more of the farmers are looking ways to grow plants effectively while adapting to the changes of climates. With more recent techniques such like machine learning, are getting more traction to its adaptable and flexible system, while traditional ai system like rule-based are based on well- established pre-written rules, are still important like machine learning as they can still predict weather pattern and planning crops planting. Due to the fact that this system uses logic created by experts, they can convert variables like heat, moisture, and even precipitation into useful practical guidance for how to protect harvest, when to water, and to estimate how much it expects to produce. Egypt serves as a good example of why is the approach is so effective, given how much the agriculture rely so much depends if there is consistent weather, changes in the temperature and rain have a huge impact on crop yields and the quality of the farm ground.  A research study from (Mohamed et al., 2025), says that a straightforward guidance rooted in current forecasts can helps smaller farms thrive; where these tools are valuable when folks need to grasp why a suggestion is being made, fostering trust since everything is out in the open. Because rule-based system struggle so much with the rapid of changing weather patterns since they sometimes fail to conform its expectations. Thereby, even though these system can help farm into adapting to different conditions, they can perform better when combined with like learning techniques like machine learning where it can be used in like image recognition as the predict weather changes more easier and quicker. This combination boosts reliability, precision, and moreover extends reach.



% ---------- METHODS ----------
\section{Methods}
In this research paper, we checked how two rule based AI models which i created to  forecasted weather by using Seattle’s historical climate patterns. Info taken from a CSV included details like weather condition, wind movement, or peak temperature values. We used Pandas for cleaning up data, while NumPy tackled math operations; Matplotlib drew charts and plots, whereas Scikit-learn tracked outcomes such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

The first AI model sorted days into "wet" or `"dry" using recorded weather and a 0.1 mm rainfall precipitation threshold. We added \texttt{"actual\_wet"} to mark the true wet days, alongside \texttt{"predicted\_wet"} for predictions from our model. The second AI model checks whether a day was "warm" based on the maximum temperature, considering it warm if it is at or above 10 degrees Celsius. We used the same steps to find \texttt{"actual\_warm"} and \texttt{"predicted\_warm"}.

measured each model’s performance, then displayed outcomes plainly through bar charts that lined up values next to one another so easily spotting gaps in accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score became straightforward.

However, this project still had some limitations as the model result depended so much on how well the data was, so small errors or mistake in the gap might lead to serious issues. Adding on, AI like rule-based might frequently find itself to have some difficulty to adapt and perform badly in unexpected situation because it ignores and overlooks small changes in the patterns it gets. In the end, changes in the weather may give incorrectly in the data sets the dont change at all.

% ---------- DISCUSSION ----------
\section{Discussion}
In the results it showed that both rule based model were effective when predicting Seattle weather. However the first model where it label days either it is dry or wet, did around 96.4\% in accuracy, and a perfect 100\% with precision, but recall got around 92.6\%, and with F1 score with a 92.6\%. Which means the false alarm were uncommon since it rarely call dry days by wet when actually they were not. Still it still marked some days as dry instead of wet. Cause of this some of the wet days were still categorized as dry day since the result of this gap. Where farming, traveling, and doing outdoor activities relies heavily when you know when it will rain, missing those predictions could lead to a big trouble

On the other hand with the model two nails without failure on both warm and cold days. This  model passed all test with perfect recall,spot on accuracy, and 100\% precision and a max score on the F1 Score metrics. where as not a single point of data was missed and everything perfectly lined up, because of the consistent temperature it steady cutoff that caught warm gaps. Thanks to its dependability, this actually makes it easier for like industries like farming, use of power, and travel may actually apply this method when planning with weather related.

Despite with all of the positive results, there are still few drawbacks that is needs to be noted. Cause the quality and accuracy of the data hinges on how well will the model can perform. While it is unclear if the performance numbers seems to holding up on a changing environment, as when they can appear good results in previous situations. Since rule-based model gets tends to harshly criticized for being over rigid and unflexibe and have trouble when dealing with all strange weather conditions. Where fixed information are becoming less trustworthy overtime since the dataset isnt updated in real time, where the real actual weather change over time.

Even so, we encountered some few surprises, especially with how the first model performed. Even though the numbers of the precision looks to be good, it some wet prediction may have been missed due to the low recall. This gaps shows that even there is some possibility that a item could’ve labeled falsely, which can lead us might very much unprepared if when it rains.

While for everyday use, these model would perform far better if they were using like machine learning, since theyre better for daily use when it comes for basic weather prediction. Where advanced versions could incorporate extra variable and dynamically adjusting for their interactions instead where of depending alone on the basic data. Which can potentially lead to more accurate forecast in real time scenarios.

It also revealed in the results the how important it is on to modify the data, especially when adding new updates to improve on the accuracy of the forecast. The models can respond quickly and more easily to unexpected weather condition if a wide broad of pool of data is gathered across longer period of time with such factors like wind speed, moisture levels, or changes in pressure.


In general, while our rule-based ai did performed okay at telling which between the two wet days and dry days or cold days and warm days, but it still faced some problems due to the inconsistent data, and rigid setups or the model within it.



% ---------- CONCLUSION ----------
\section{Conclusion}
To sum up, testing both rule-based systems on Seattle’s weather highlights what each can do well - and where they fall short. The first model splits rainy from dry days pretty accurately, hitting 96.4\% precision, yet its recall dipped to 92.6\%, meaning some damp days slipped through labeled as dry. Outside lab settings, that gap matters - spotting dry stretches helps, though catching every rainy day counts just as much, particularly in areas such as farming or travel planning where errors lead to actual setbacks. Meanwhile, the second system nailed every test run when sorting chilly from mild temperatures, proving solid for jobs tied to shifts in heat. Given how perfectly it did, alot of industries that rely on how accurate the temperature predict, such as where those sizing energy needs or when you need to schedule outdoor events, are not taking notice. However, with minimal change inside the date, while it make more sense to hold it off before adding it out in the real-world. 

Though results go beyond how well the method works, they point to deeper problems - especially when data’s shaky or software updates feel clunky in weather predictions. As conditions shift fast, rigid setups often stumble because weather won’t stick to a fixed script. These methods may seem fine at first, yet slowly reveal why adaptability matters more as time goes on. Coming projects need smart systems that respond live to quick changes - say, spikes in moisture, gusts of wind, or wild pressure drops - to make forecasts sharper.

These models show small tweaks matter - they keep existing info but learn patterns quicker. Because of this, fixing mistakes might boost forecast accuracy, helping sectors adapt faster as conditions shift. Even so, early results suggest setups reacting sooner and acting more like actual events.
